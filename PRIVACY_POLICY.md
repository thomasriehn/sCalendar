# Privacy Policy for sCalendar

**Last updated: January 17, 2026**

## Overview

sCalendar ("the App") is a calendar application that helps you view and manage your calendar events. Your privacy is important to us. This policy explains what data the App accesses and how it is used.

## Data We Access

### Calendar Data
The App requests access to your device's calendars through Apple's EventKit framework. This includes:
- Calendar names and colors
- Event titles, dates, times, and locations
- Event notes and recurrence information

**This data never leaves your device.** The App reads and writes calendar data only to display events and allow you to create, edit, or delete events. All calendar data is stored by Apple's built-in Calendar system, not by the App.

### Preferences
The App stores your preferences locally on your device:
- Selected language
- Calendar visibility settings (which calendars to show/hide)
- Calendar color customizations

These preferences are stored using Apple's standard storage mechanisms (UserDefaults and iCloud Key-Value Store) and are not accessible to us.

## Data We Do NOT Collect

- We do not collect personal information
- We do not collect analytics or usage data
- We do not track your location
- We do not use advertising or ad tracking
- We do not share any data with third parties

## iCloud Sync

If you have iCloud enabled, your calendar visibility and customization preferences may sync across your devices using Apple's iCloud Key-Value Store. This is handled entirely by Apple's infrastructure. We do not have access to this data.

## Data Security

All calendar data is managed by Apple's EventKit and remains on your device or in your personal iCloud account. The App does not transmit any data to external servers.

## Children's Privacy

The App does not knowingly collect any personal information from children under 13 years of age.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated revision date.
