    <h1>Privacy Policy for sCalendar</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated: January 17, 2026</strong></p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>sCalendar ("the App") is a calendar application that helps you view and manage your calendar events. Your privacy is important to us. This policy explains what data the App accesses and how it is used.</p>

    <h2>Data We Access</h2>
    <h3>Calendar Data</h3>
    <p>The App requests access to your device's calendars through Apple's EventKit framework. This includes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Calendar names and colors</li>
        <li>Event titles, dates, times, and locations</li>
        <li>Event notes and recurrence information</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>This data never leaves your device.</strong> The App reads and writes calendar data only to display events and allow you to create, edit, or delete events. All calendar data is stored by Apple's built-in Calendar system, not by the App.</p>

    <h3>Preferences</h3>
    <p>The App stores your preferences locally on your device:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Selected language</li>
        <li>Calendar visibility settings (which calendars to show/hide)</li>
        <li>Calendar color customizations</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These preferences are stored using Apple's standard storage mechanisms (UserDefaults and iCloud Key-Value Store) and are not accessible to us.</p>

    <h2>Data We Do NOT Collect</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>We do not collect personal information</li>
        <li>We do not collect analytics or usage data</li>
        <li>We do not track your location</li>
        <li>We do not use advertising or ad tracking</li>
        <li>We do not share any data with third parties</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>iCloud Sync</h2>
    <p>If you have iCloud enabled, your calendar visibility and customization preferences may sync across your devices using Apple's iCloud Key-Value Store. This is handled entirely by Apple's infrastructure. We do not have access to this data.</p>

    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>All calendar data is managed by Apple's EventKit and remains on your device or in your personal iCloud account. The App does not transmit any data to external servers.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>The App does not knowingly collect any personal information from children under 13 years of age.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated revision date.</p>
